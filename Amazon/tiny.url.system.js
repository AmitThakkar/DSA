/*
 * This is system has perfect use case for hash table or hash maps. Hash tables are data structures which store key
 * value pairs where lookup operation for a given key is O(1). So, given a key itâ€™s corresponding value can be
 * found in constant time.
 *
 * As allowed characters in url are a-z, A-Z and 0-9, the number of possibilities for each place in three character
 * long url is 62, which can represent 2^62  (approx. 250,000) urls. If urls never expire and more url needs to be
 * shortened, the system has to use 4 character which will eventually hit the limit and hence size will be increase
 * to 5 characters.
